 * Each feature is delegated to any origin (`feature *`) so that the embedded
 * StackBlitz document — and any (potentially cross-origin) iframes it nests,
 * such as project previews — can actually use them. A feature can only be used
 * in a nested frame if every ancestor frame was granted it, so the outer embed
 * frame must delegate the feature for it to reach a preview iframe deeper down.
 *
 * `cross-origin-isolated` is intentionally omitted: it does not accept the `*`
 * allowlist value and is delegated separately to the StackBlitz origin.
